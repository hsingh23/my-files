00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,660
This is a brand new song that I wrote really recently, like less than a couple of weeks ago

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:16,519
while I was in Melbourne, and I hope you enjoy it.

3
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:31,399
You tell me that you love me

4
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,600
When I'm lying by your side

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,219
You tell me that I am the only one

6
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:43,719
Who understands your troubled mind

7
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,939
That I am blind to any evil you could do

8
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:56,679
And that I love you more than any other girl could ever do

9
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,619
You love the things that I love

10
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:03,579
You love art and you love books

11
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:06,280
And you love love as much as I do

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:27,212
And you love my dirty looks Sing you love me right now So how can you love Vegemite

13
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:30,912
It tastes like sadness

14
00:01:30,912 --> 00:01:34,652
It tastes like batteries

15
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:38,272
It tastes like asses

16
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:42,951
I cannot hold a man so close

17
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:46,492
Who spreads this cancer on his toast

18
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:49,751
It is the Vegemite

19
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:52,312
My darling, or it's me

20
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,831
You have to make a fucking choice

21
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:57,512
I cannot sit with you at breakfast

22
00:01:57,512 --> 00:02:02,331
The very smell of it obliterates my senses

23
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,412
And if that weren't bad enough

24
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:10,072
You also eat the shit for lunch, which means we can't spend any time together.

25
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:13,072
What kind of relationship is that?

26
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:17,072
The choice is yours.

27
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:36,624
My heart is in your hands Please wash your hands You just ate Vegemite for lunch you selfish bastard It all about you isn it It just take take take take What about me What about my feelings

28
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:41,624
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:47,624
I had this really awful experience when I was six years old and our British next door neighbour, Christopher Gill,

30
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:54,104
Christopher Gill, he was babysitting us and he made me eat an entire spoonful of Marmite,

31
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:57,784
which is just like Vegemite pretty much, except it's even grosser.

32
00:02:57,784 --> 00:03:01,504
And but he told me he made me eat it by telling me that it was chocolate fudge.

33
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:06,344
And so I swallowed the whole thing and then I had to go to the bathroom and throw up and

34
00:03:06,344 --> 00:03:08,004
it really traumatized me.

35
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:10,564
And I'm sorry I got so emotional.

36
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:11,564
I just...

37
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:15,344
I love you.

38
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:25,624
And no matter what you eat, I'll always love you completely.

39
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:29,624
I might just always leave the room at mealtimes,

40
00:03:29,624 --> 00:03:43,915
or refuse to kiss or touch you for a week If you insist on putting that foul death paste in your mouth You in my heart

41
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:47,436
Put yourself inside my shoes

42
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:49,556
I have to know

43
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:54,376
It shouldn't be too hard to choose

44
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:57,596
I know it's tearing you apart

45
00:03:57,596 --> 00:04:01,976
But it's the way it has to be

46
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:06,676
It is the Vegemite, my darling

47
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:13,456
It is the Vegemite, my darling

48
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:19,356
Put down the Vegemite, you fucker

49
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:24,755
Or I'll leave

50
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:40,916
Thank you.
